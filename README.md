# Face Attendance System

An **AI-powered Face Recognition Attendance System** built using **Python, OpenCV, and pyttsx3**.
This project automates the process of **employee/student attendance marking** by detecting and recognizing faces in real-time through a webcam.

---

## Key Features

* **Employee Registration** 

  * Capture multiple face images using the webcam.
  * Stores face samples in the `dataset/` folder.
  * Saves employee details in `Employee/info.txt`.

* **Model Training** 

  * Uses **OpenCV‚Äôs LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram)** face recognizer.
  * Trains a recognition model (`trainer.yml`) using the registered face samples.

* **Attendance Marking** 

  * Recognizes registered employees in real-time.
  * Marks their attendance in `attendance.csv` with timestamp.
  * Prevents duplicate attendance on the same day.

* **Voice Feedback** 

  * Speaks important system events using `pyttsx3`.
  * Example: *‚ÄúAttendance marked for John Doe‚Äù*.

* **Menu Driven System** 

  * Easy-to-use **CLI menu** with options:

    1. Register New Employee
    2. Train Model
    3. Start Attendance
    4. Exit

##  Requirements

You‚Äôll need the following installed on your system:

* Python **3.7+**
* OpenCV (with contrib module)
* NumPy
* pyttsx3

Install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-contrib-python numpy pyttsx3
```

## Usage Guide

### 1,Run the System

```bash
python face_attendance.py
```

### 2Ô∏è,Main Menu Options

```
========================================
     FACE ATTENDANCE SYSTEM
========================================
1. Register New Employee
2. Train Model
3. Start Attendance
4. Exit
```

### 3Ô∏è,Step by Step Workflow

1. **Register New Employee**

   * Enter a unique **numeric Employee ID** and **Name**.
   * Look into the webcam ‚Üí system captures **20 face samples**.
   * Press `Q` to stop manually.
   * Data is saved in `dataset/` and `Employee/info.txt`.

2. **Train Model**

   * Trains the LBPH face recognizer using stored face images.
   * Creates `trainer.yml` (the trained model).

3. **Start Attendance**

   * Opens webcam and starts detecting faces.
   * Recognized employees are marked in `attendance.csv`.
   * Duplicate attendance for the same day is **prevented**.
   * Press `Q` to stop attendance session.

4. **Exit**

   * Closes the program safely.

## Attendance Format

All attendance is logged in `attendance.csv` in the format:

```
EmployeeID,Name,Timestamp
101,John Doe,2025-08-28 10:32:15
102,Jane Smith,2025-08-28 10:33:01
```

## 1.Installation & Setup
Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Debojeet-ops/Face-Attendance-System.git
cd Face-Attendance-System

## 2Ô∏è.Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
Then install required libraries:

pip install opencv-contrib-python numpy pyttsx3

## 3Ô∏è.Run the Program
python face_attendance.py

---

## Future Improvements

* Add **GUI (Tkinter or PyQt)** for user-friendly interface.
* Store attendance in a **database (SQLite/MySQL)** instead of CSV.
* Email/SMS notifications for attendance.
* Deploy as a **web application** using Flask/Django.
